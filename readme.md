# Responding to actions

After writing the very well known "Hello World", I wondered... How should I start cleaning my code and increasing the complexity?

So, adding a few buttons should make things a bit more interesting (in preparation for a todo list or a master detailed app).

This `Actions` app gives you options and you should answer properly to the question.

## What will I find here?

- A simple app with three buttons and a question.
- Providing an answer will give you a message.
- Restructured code to extract in a neater way resources and other components. For Instance, decided to not use the standard `Button` and implemented mine (not an original idea, plenty of other places where the author is doing something similar); the idea is to have a square area to tap on as opposed to a link-ish button.

## Interesting to note

If you choose the middle option, there is no second `alert` shown after the original has triggered... Wonder what is going on there...
